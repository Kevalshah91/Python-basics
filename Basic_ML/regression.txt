**Summary Report**

**1. Problem Statement:**
   - The goal was to develop a machine learning model to predict transfer fees for football players based on their attributes.

**2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Explored the dataset containing information about players' attributes, including market value, team from/to, season, and age.
   - Handled missing values in the 'Market_value' column using median imputation.
   - Preprocessed categorical variables using label encoding.
   - Selected features 'Market_value', 'Team_from', 'Season', and 'Age' for training the model.

**3. Model Training:**
   - Trained a regression model (`MyModel`) using scikit-learn, based on the selected features.
   - Explored various regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
   - Evaluated the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score.
   - Tuned hyperparameters of the best-performing model using techniques such as grid search or random search.

**4. Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the trained model's performance on the test dataset and performed K-fold cross-validation to assess its generalization ability.
   - Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation results.

**5. Conclusion:**
   - Developed a machine learning model to predict transfer fees for football players, achieving satisfactory performance.
   - The model can be further improved by incorporating additional features or experimenting with different algorithms.
