### Project Description:
Title: Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model employing the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to predict customer churn within a banking context. Customer churn, or customer attrition, poses a critical challenge for businesses, necessitating proactive measures to retain customers and sustain business growth.

The dataset utilized in this project encompasses diverse customer attributes, including demographics, banking behaviors, and interactions with the bank. A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to unveil the dataset's intrinsic characteristics and discern pivotal factors influencing customer churn.

Subsequently, meticulous data preprocessing techniques were applied, encompassing handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The preprocessed data served as the foundation for training a Random Forest Classifier model tailored to forecast customer churn.

The model's performance evaluation entailed a thorough examination of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, cross-validation techniques were employed to gauge the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

The culmination of this endeavor yielded a highly effective predictive model, showcasing promising results with an accuracy score of [insert accuracy score here]. By deploying this model, businesses can proactively identify customers at risk of churn and devise targeted retention strategies, thereby enhancing customer retention rates and bolstering overall business profitability.

### Dataset Terminologies:
1. **Complain**: Binary indicator denoting whether the customer has filed a complaint (0: No, 1: Yes).
2. **Age**: Age of the customer.
3. **NumOfProducts**: Number of bank products utilized by the customer.
4. **Balance**: Account balance of the customer.
5. **IsActiveMember**: Binary indicator signifying whether the customer is an active member (0: No, 1: Yes).
6. **Point Earned**: Points accrued by the customer through banking transactions.
7. **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated salary of the customer.
8. **CreditScore**: Credit score of the customer.
9. **Tenure**: Duration of the customer's tenure with the bank.
10. **Geography**: Geographic location of the customer (0: France, 1: Germany, 2: Spain).
11. **Gender**: Gender of the customer (0: Female, 1: Male).

These defined terminologies offer valuable insights into the attributes employed for predicting customer churn and serve as essential reference points for interpreting the project's outcomes.
